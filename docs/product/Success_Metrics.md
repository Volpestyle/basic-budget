# Success Metrics

## North Star Metric (suggested)
**% of active users who check “left to spend” and log/import at least 10 transactions per month.**

Rationale: captures engagement and the core behavior the app enables (daily decision-making).

## Activation
- Budget created within 24 hours of install
- Categories created ≥ 6
- First transaction logged/imported within 48 hours

## Engagement
- Weekly active users / monthly active users (WAU/MAU)
- Median app opens per week
- “Left to spend” checks per week

## Retention
- D1, D7, D30 retention
- % of users completing a full budget period review

## Financial outcome proxies (opt-in, privacy-safe)
- Reduction in overspend frequency (months with any category overspent)
- Average overspend amount per user per month

## Quality & reliability
- Crash-free sessions
- Transaction sync error rate (if bank integration)
- Time to interactive (cold start)
